> A modern, production-ready Rust self-hosting solution built with Axum, Docker, Traefik, and automated CI/CD. Perfect for developers who want to own their infrastructure.

## 🤔 Why This Repository?

In an era of cloud vendor lock-in and rising hosting costs, **self-hosting is making a comeback**. This repository provides a battle-tested foundation for modern self-hosting with:

- **🛡️ Security-first approach** with automatic HTTPS, security headers, and rate limiting
- **⚡ Performance-optimized** Rust backend with minimal resource footprint
- **🔄 Zero-downtime deployments** through GitHub Actions and Docker
- **📈 Production-grade monitoring** and observability built-in
- **🎯 Developer-friendly** setup that gets you running in minutes, not hours

Whether you're hosting personal projects, side businesses, or enterprise applications, this stack gives you the reliability of cloud providers with the control of self-hosting.

## ⚡ Quick Start

Get up and running in 4 simple commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone and navigate
git clone https://github.com/a-ariff/rust-selfhost-server.git && cd rust-selfhost-server

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env && nano .env  # Set your domain and email

# 3. Deploy with Docker Compose
docker compose up -d

# 4. Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.com
```

**That's it!** Your Rust server is now live with automatic HTTPS. 🎉

### Core Components

| Component | Purpose | Port | Status |
|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| **Rust Server** | Main application (Axum framework) | 3000 | ✅ Production Ready |
| **Traefik** | Reverse proxy + HTTPS termination | 80/443 | ✅ Auto-configured |
| **Let's Encrypt** | SSL certificate management | - | ✅ Automatic renewal |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI/CD pipeline | - | ✅ Zero-downtime |

## 🚀 Production Features

### Security
- 🔒 **Automatic HTTPS** with Let's Encrypt certificates
- 🛡️ **Security headers** (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
- ⚡ **Rate limiting** (100 req/sec with burst protection)
- 🔐 **Non-root containers** for enhanced security

### Performance
- 🦀 **Rust performance** - sub-millisecond response times
- 📦 **Optimized Docker images** with multi-stage builds
- 🗜️ **Automatic compression** (gzip/brotli)
- 💾 **Memory efficient** - runs comfortably on 512MB RAM

### Operations
- 📊 **Prometheus metrics** endpoint for monitoring
- 📝 **Structured logging** in JSON format
- 🔄 **Health checks** for container orchestration
- 📈 **Traefik dashboard** for traffic insights

- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] Traefik reverse proxy setup
- [x] Let's Encrypt HTTPS automation
- [x] GitHub Actions CI/CD
- [x] Production-ready security headers

### v1.1 - Enhanced Monitoring 🚧

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: VPS Deployment (Recommended)
Perfect for production workloads with full control.

**Requirements:**
- VPS with 1GB+ RAM
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or similar
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Domain name with DNS access

### Option 2: Local Development
Great for testing and development.

```bash
# Run without HTTPS for local testing
DOMAIN=localhost docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Option 3: Cloud Deployment
Deploy to AWS, DigitalOcean, or any cloud provider.

```bash
# Use cloud-init script for automated setup
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-ariff/rust-selfhost-server/main/scripts/cloud-init.sh | bash
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `DOMAIN` | Your domain name | `example.com` | ✅ |
| `TRAEFIK_ACME_EMAIL` | Email for Let's Encrypt | `admin@example.com` | ✅ |
| `RUST_LOG` | Logging level | `info` | ❌ |
| `PORT` | Internal server port | `3000` | ❌ |

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced setups, see our [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration.md).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 🚨 Certificate Generation Fails
```bash
# Check domain DNS
nslookup your-domain.com

# Verify Traefik logs
docker compose logs traefik

# Test HTTP-01 challenge
curl -I http://your-domain.com/.well-known/acme-challenge/test
```

#### 🚨 Service Not Accessible
```bash
# Check service status
docker compose ps

# Verify environment variables
cat .env

# Test internal connectivity
docker compose exec rust-server curl localhost:3000
```

#### 🚨 Deployment Fails
```bash
# Verify GitHub secrets
# Settings → Secrets → Actions → Environment secrets

# Test SSH connectivity
ssh user@your-server-ip "docker --version"

# Check GitHub Actions logs
# Actions tab → Latest workflow run
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# View all logs
docker compose logs -f

# Check specific service
docker compose logs rust-server

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats

# Inspect container health
docker compose exec rust-server ps aux
```
